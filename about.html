<h1>About RDF/SPARQL Starter Kit</h1>

<p>The starter kit is very low-level, intended to help developers get started with other tasks like creating APIs functions based on the graph contents.</p>
<p>The starter kit makes it easy to connect to a SPARQL endpoint; configure a graph and namespaces; and insert/delete triples.</p>
<p>A viewer is available for browsing the "triples" in the graph.</p>
<p>The starter kit is NOT meant to "visualize" RDF graphs. Again, this is very low level for developers.</p>

<h3>Future release notes:</h3>
<p>The basic input form is working, but it could be better.</p>
<p>Here's what I would like the form to look like in future releases.</p>
<pre>
Graph:     <select><option>Example app 1</option></select>
Subject:   <select><option>contacts:</option></select><input value="ID-12345" /> <a href="#">generate</a>
Predicate: <select><option>foaf:</option></select><input value="name" />
Object:    <input value="Joe" />
           <input type="radio" checked />String <input type="radio" />URI <input type="radio" />Date
           
           <input type="submit" />
</pre>

<p>The new form would have the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choosing the graph for the insert statements using select box.</li>
  <li>A "generate" option for generating unique subject IDs, and where the generation method is pluggable.</li>
	<li>Choosing namespaces using select box.</li>
	<li>Choosing the type of object, using radio buttons.</li>
  <li>Also, if more typing space is needed then it would be good to have an "expand" feature, which turns the input field into a textarea.</li>
</ul>
